# Capital One Coding Excercise
This project is a coding excercise from the good folks at Capital One. I completed it, and it's pretty sweet.'
## Requirments
- Xcode 8.3
- Git 2.12.2
## Installation
To get this file, open Terminal and enter ```git clone https://github.com/WikipediaBrown/Capital-One-Coding-Exercise.git```. After you've cloned the repository, open the directory it came in and double tap the file named ```CapitolOneCodingExercise.xcodeproj```. Then press the play button in the upper left hand corner of Xcode and the app will run in the simulator.
## Usage
The app starts with a loading screen as it goes and gets all of the records. After the records are aquired and organized, users can traers their transactions seperated into month sections. The headers contain aggregate data for the month and a donut button can be tapped to show aggregates for all transactions and all transactions sans donuts. the navigation bar has labels showing spending and income in an everage month. each cell displays data about the transaction (the data I thought was pertinent to a user). Pressing the Red button on the navigation bar brings up a view with found credit card payments organized by month. The payments are listed with the months in the header. Pressing the red button in the navigation bar dismisses the modal.
